I built a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to practice my JavaScript and front-end skills. In this project, two players can play turn by turn by selecting X and O on a 3×3 grid. The game automatically checks for a winner or draw and also has a reset option to start a new game. This project helped me improve my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic.
